## Resume
During my academic studies, I first developed a deep interest in Mandarin and Chinese culture, which I had the opportunity to explore while studing in China. Afterward coming from scientific background, I was naturally drawn to computer science, where I discovered the perfect synergy in Natural Language Processing (NLP), right at the crossroad of linguistics and computer science.
