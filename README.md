## Resume
During my academic studies, I first developed a deep interest in Mandarin and Chinese culture, which I had the opportunity to explore while studing in China. Aterward coming from scientific background, I was naturally drawn to computer science, where I discovered the perfect synergy in NLP, right at the crossroad of linguistics and computer science.
